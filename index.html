   <h2>The concept of supply and demand</h2>

   <p>

     Although some consumers buy a pair of shoes because of its history, shape or color, the criterion that suddenly made the sneakers market grow was the setting up of prints. Before, brands adapted their production to demand, now it is the demand that must bend to the stocks that brands offer. The concept of "shortage" has logically led to a rise in resale prices. This technique has allowed several models to become fashionable more than 20 or 30 years after their creation.
